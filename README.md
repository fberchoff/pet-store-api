# Front End week 12 - Pet Store API

This is an API that is used by the week 12 front-end application. Clone this repository on your local PC and run as a java application before testing the front-end piece.


## Features

- Uses an in-memory database so no database setup needed.
- Use the following end point in your Microsoft Edge browser to verify data changes (Edge formats the JSON for you): http://localhost:8080/pet_store/pet_store.
- Alternatively, you can use the H2 console to view the data. In your browser, navigate to http://localhost:8080/h2-console.  Leave everything at default values except for the URL.  The URL should be jdbc:h2:mem:pet_store;MODE=MYSQL.
